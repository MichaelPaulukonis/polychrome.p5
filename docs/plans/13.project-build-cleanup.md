# Plan 13: Project Build Cleanup

## 1. Objective

To achieve a clean, functional production build by eliminating all build-time warnings and optimizing the final CSS assets. This plan consolidates and replaces the previous `11.sass-slash-div-migration.md` and `12.sass-deprecation-fixes.md`, and also documents the addition of `PurgeCSS`.

---

## 2. Execution Plan

### Part A: CSS Asset Optimization (Completed)

This step ensures that the production build is as small as possible by removing unused CSS.

-   **Task:** Add and configure `@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss` to the Nuxt build process.
-   **Details:** The configuration was added to `nuxt.config.js` to scan `.vue` and `.js` files and remove any unused CSS classes from the final build artifacts in the `dist/` directory.
-   **Status:** ✅ **Completed**

### Part B: Sass Deprecation Fixes (Pending)

This multi-step process will eliminate all Sass-related deprecation warnings from the build output.

#### Step 1: Fix `slash-div` and Deprecated Function Warnings (Completed)

-   **Warnings:** `DEPRECATION WARNING [slash-div]`, `DEPRECATION WARNING [global-builtin]`, `DEPRECATION WARNING [color-functions]`
-   **Action:** Manually updated the affected `.scss` files to replace deprecated division and function calls with their modern, namespaced equivalents (e.g., `math.div()`, `color.adjust()`).
-   **Status:** ✅ **Completed and Committed**

#### Step 2: Migrate from `@import` to `@use` (Revised Plan)

-   **Warning:** `DEPRECATION WARNING [import]`
-   **Action:** Use the official `sass-migrator` tool to automatically and correctly migrate the entire dependency tree from `@import` to the modern `@use` syntax. This is the recommended and safest approach.
-   **Entrypoint:** The primary entrypoint for the application's styles has been identified as `assets/css/main.scss`.
-   **Command:** `npx sass-migrator module --migrate-deps assets/css/main.scss`

#### Step 3: Address Post-Migration Errors

-   **Action:** After the migrator runs, the build will be executed. It is anticipated that new errors may arise due to Sass's stricter module system (e.g., variables not being globally available). These errors will be addressed methodically by editing the affected `.scss` files to ensure all dependencies are explicitly declared.

#### Step 4: Investigate Legacy JS API Warning

-   **Warning:** `DEPRECATION WARNING [legacy-js-api]`
-   **Action:** This warning is likely related to the Sass loader version used by Nuxt 2. If it persists after all other fixes, it will be investigated separately. It may not be fixable without a major dependency upgrade, but it does not break the build.

## 3. Verification

After each step, the build will be run using `npm run build` to confirm that the targeted warnings have been resolved and no new errors have been introduced. After all steps are complete, a final visual check of the application will be performed.
