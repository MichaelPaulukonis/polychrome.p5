# Summary of SCSS Deprecation Fix Attempts

## Objective

To achieve a clean, functional production build by eliminating all SCSS deprecation warnings.

## Core Problem

A fundamental conflict was identified between the project's method of providing global styles (`@nuxtjs/style-resources`) and the modern Sass `@use` module system. The `style-resources` module works by prepending SCSS files to other files during the build. This architectural choice is incompatible with the `@use` rule, which strictly requires that it be the very first statement in a file, before any other code.

## Failed Troubleshooting Cycle

Our attempts to fix the warnings led to a circular loop of errors:

1.  **Initial Action:** Migrated `assets/css/main.scss` from the deprecated `@import` to the modern `@use`.
    *   **Resulting Error:** `SassError: @use rules must be written before any other rules.`
    *   **Reason:** The `@nuxtjs/style-resources` module injected global variable files *before* the new `@use` statements in `main.scss`, violating the Sass specification.

2.  **Counter-Action:** To solve the `@use` order error, the `@nuxtjs/style-resources` module was removed from `nuxt.config.js`.
    *   **Resulting Error:** `SassError: Undefined variable.`
    *   **Reason:** Files like `_grid.scss`, `_fonts.scss`, and various Vue components depended on globally available variables (e.g., `$gutter`, `$screen-sm`, `$primary`). Removing `style-resources` eliminated this global scope.

3.  **Second Counter-Action:** To solve the "Undefined variable" error, we attempted to add explicit `@use` statements for the variable files directly into the individual files that needed them.
    *   **Resulting Error:** This immediately led back to the original `SassError: @use rules must be written before any other rules`, as the build process still created order-of-operation conflicts.

This cycle demonstrated that a simple migration to `@use` is not possible without first re-architecting how global styles are handled.

## Conclusion & Recommended Alternate Course of Action

The attempt to migrate to `@use` is the primary source of the instability. The most logical and productive path forward is to **postpone the `@use` migration**.

Instead, we should focus on achievable, incremental improvements:

1.  **Restore Stability:** Revert the codebase to the last known-good commit where the build succeeds (albeit with warnings).
2.  **Fix Low-Hanging Fruit:** Methodically fix *only* the `slash-div` and deprecated function (`lighten`, `percentage`) warnings. We have previously achieved a successful build with these specific fixes in place.
3.  **Commit Progress:** Create a stable commit with these limited, successful changes. This reduces build noise without introducing risk.
4.  **Isolate the Core Problem:** Treat the larger `@import` to `@use` migration as a separate, future architectural task. It will require a more considered approach than is feasible right now and is not critical for a functional build.
