### 1. My Previous Understanding of the Problem

My initial hypothesis was that the `zone.graphics` buffer was rendering in black because it was not being initialized with the correct HSB color mode and that the color calculation functions were using the main canvas's dimensions.

### 2. The Steps I Took to Resolve It

I attempted to fix this by passing the zone's `width` and `height` to the `paint` function and initializing the zone's color mode upon creation. This was insufficient because it didn't address the root cause.

### 3. Deeper Analysis & Root Cause (Revised)

My previous fix failed because the problem is more fundamental. The core issue lies within the `color-system.js` module itself, as you correctly pointed out.

1.  **Incorrect Drawing Target:** The functions within `color-system` (e.g., `setFillMode`, `setOutlineMode`) do not accept a `layer` or `canvas` parameter. They implicitly operate on the main `p5` instance (`this.p5.fill(...)`), which targets the default canvas. They are not aware of the existence of the `zone.graphics` buffer, so they never apply colors to it. This is the primary reason the zone remains black.

2.  **Inconsistent Context:** The `color-system` is created once and holds a reference to the main `p5` object. It has no mechanism to switch its drawing context to a different graphics buffer like the one for the zone. All its calculations and drawing commands are hard-coded to the main canvas.

3.  **Shallow Refactoring:** My previous attempt to pass `width` and `height` into the `paint` function was a shallow fix. The `paint` function correctly dispatched the drawing operation to the zone's layer, but the underlying `colorSystem`—which the painters call—was still fundamentally unaware of this new target.

**Conclusion:**

The fix requires a more significant refactoring of the `color-system` to make it context-aware. Every function within it that sets a color or applies a fill/stroke needs to be modified to accept a `layer` argument, ensuring it directs its commands to the intended graphics buffer (`zone.graphics` or `layers.drawingCanvas`). The drawing mode painters must then be updated to pass this `layer` context to the `color-system`.
