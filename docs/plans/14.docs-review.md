# Plan: Documentation Review and Update

**Date:** 2025-07-26

**Authors:** GitHub Copilot

## 1. Problem Statement

The documentation in `docs/src` may be outdated after recent refactoring of the `src` directory. This can lead to confusion for developers and users, and it hinders the maintainability of the project.

## 2. Requirements

- Review all files in `docs/src`.
- Compare each documentation file with the corresponding source code in `src`.
- Update existing documentation to reflect changes in the source code.
- Create new documentation for any new modules in `src` that are not yet documented.
- Ensure all code examples and function signatures in the documentation are accurate.
- The `sketch.md` file, which is the main entry point, should be prioritized and thoroughly reviewed.

## 3. Technical Approach

- I will systematically go through each file in the `src` directory.
- For each file, I will read its content and then read the corresponding documentation file from `docs/src`.
- I will perform a side-by-side comparison to identify discrepancies.
- I will use `semantic_search` to find relevant code snippets and understand the purpose of different functions and modules.
- I will update the documentation files using `insert_edit_into_file`.

## 4. Implementation Steps

1.  **Analyze `sketch.js` and update `sketch.md`:** Start with the main `sketch.js` file and its documentation, as it is the core of the project.
2.  **Review `canvas-transforms`:** Compare `src/canvas-transforms` with `docs/src/canvas-transforms.md`.
3.  **Review `color` module:** Compare `src/color` with `docs/src/color.md`.
4.  **Review `drawing-modes`:** Compare `src/drawing-modes` with `docs/src/drawing-modes.md`.
5.  **Review `gui` module:** Compare `src/gui` with `docs/src/gui.md`.
6.  **Review `scripting` module:** Compare `src/scripting` with `docs/src/scripting.md`.
7.  **Review `text` module:** Compare `src/text` with `docs/src/text.md`.
8.  **Review `undo` module:** Compare `src/undo` with `docs/src/undo.md`.
9.  **Review `utils` module:** Compare `src/utils` with `docs/src/utils.md`.
10. **Identify and document any new modules.**
11. **Enhance Instructions:** Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to ask the user, after new features or refactoring, if they want to update `docs/`.

## 5. Validation

- After updating each document, I will re-read it to ensure clarity and accuracy.
- I will use the `get_errors` tool to check for any syntax errors in the updated documentation files (if applicable, for markdown linting).
- I will ask the user to review the updated documentation.

## 6. Risks & Mitigation

-   **Risk:** Missing some changes during the review.
    -   **Mitigation:** A systematic, file-by-file approach will be used. I will also rely on the user's final review.
-   **Risk:** The `src` directory structure might have changed significantly, making one-to-one mapping difficult.
    -   **Mitigation:** I will use `file_search` and `list_dir` to understand the current structure of the `src` directory.

## 7. Dependencies

- Access to the latest version of the `src` and `docs/src` directories.
- User availability for feedback and review.
