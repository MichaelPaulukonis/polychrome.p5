# Undo System Refactor Plan

## Overview
This plan implements the immediate fixes identified in the technical analysis to improve reliability and maintainability of the undo system while maintaining current functionality.

## Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (Current Implementation)

### Goal
Reduce complexity and improve reliability without changing the fundamental circular buffer architecture.

### Changes Planned

#### 1. Simplify State Tracking
**Current Problem**: Complex interrelated counters (`undoSteps`, `redoSteps`, `totalStored`) with confusing validation logic.

**Solution**: Replace with clearer state variables and simpler calculations.

```javascript
// Replace complex calculations with clear state
this.maxPosition = levels - 1        // Maximum valid position in buffer
this.currentPosition = -1            // Current position (-1 = no history)
this.newestPosition = -1             // Newest stored position
this.availableStates = 0             // How many states are actually stored
```

**Benefits**:
- Intuitive state representation
- Easier debugging and reasoning
- Clear relationship between positions and available operations

#### 2. Separate Concerns
**Current Problem**: `CircImgCollection.show()` mixes storage and rendering responsibilities.

**Solution**: Move rendering logic to `UndoLayers` class.

**Changes**:
- `CircImgCollection` becomes pure storage/retrieval
- `UndoLayers.show()` handles rendering and graphics state
- Clear separation between buffer management and canvas operations

#### 3. Add State Validation
**Current Problem**: No validation of internal state consistency.

**Solution**: Add defensive state validation.

```javascript
_validateState() {
  assert(this.currentPosition >= -1 && this.currentPosition < this.levels)
  assert(this.newestPosition >= -1 && this.newestPosition < this.levels)
  assert(this.availableStates >= 0 && this.availableStates <= this.levels)
}
```

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Update Test Suite
1. Add test cases for edge cases identified in analysis
2. Add state validation tests
3. Ensure comprehensive coverage of circular buffer behavior
4. Test intermittent redo failure scenarios

#### Step 2: Refactor State Management
1. Replace complex counter logic with clear position tracking
2. Simplify `takeSnapshot()` logic
3. Simplify `undo()` and `redo()` validation
4. Add state validation calls

#### Step 3: Separate Rendering Concerns
1. Move rendering logic from `CircImgCollection.show()` to `UndoLayers`
2. Make `CircImgCollection` purely about storage
3. Update method signatures and responsibilities

#### Step 4: Testing and Validation
1. Run comprehensive test suite
2. Manual testing of all undo/redo scenarios
3. Test integration with existing features
4. Performance validation

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests cover identified edge cases
- [ ] No visual changes in application behavior
- [ ] Redo intermittent failures eliminated
- [ ] Code is easier to understand and debug
- [ ] State validation prevents corruption

## Implementation Details

### New State Model
```javascript
class UndoLayers {
  constructor(layers, renderFunc, levels) {
    // Clear, intuitive state tracking
    let currentPosition = -1      // Where we are in history (-1 = initial state)
    let newestPosition = -1       // Newest stored position
    let availableStates = 0       // Number of states actually stored
    const maxStates = levels      // Maximum buffer size
    
    // Simplified operations
    this.canUndo = () => currentPosition > -1
    this.canRedo = () => currentPosition < newestPosition
  }
}
```

### Simplified Logic
```javascript
// Clear undo logic
this.undo = () => {
  if (this.canUndo()) {
    currentPosition--
    this.show()
  }
}

// Clear redo logic  
this.redo = () => {
  if (this.canRedo()) {
    currentPosition++
    this.show()
  }
}
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Breaking Changes
- **Risk**: Logic changes break existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test coverage before changes
- **Validation**: Side-by-side comparison testing

### Performance Impact
- **Risk**: New validation adds overhead
- **Mitigation**: Lightweight validation, disable in production if needed
- **Validation**: Performance benchmarking

### Integration Issues
- **Risk**: Changes affect other systems (canvas transforms, recording, etc.)
- **Mitigation**: Isolated testing of each integration point
- **Validation**: Full application testing

## Future Phases (Post-Immediate Fixes)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Add operation metadata storage
- Implement compression for large canvases
- Add branching support for non-linear history

### Phase 3: Architectural Migration
- Evaluate Linear Array vs Circular Buffer performance

## Implementation Log

### Changes Made (Implementation Phase)

#### 1. Enhanced Test Suite
- Added specific test for intermittent redo failures (`should handle redo consistently after complex sequences`)
- Added test for buffer size boundary conditions (`should handle redo at buffer size boundaries`)
- Added rapid undo/redo sequence testing
- Added state validation testing

#### 2. Simplified State Management - COMPLETED
**What Changed**: Replaced complex `undoSteps`, `redoSteps`, `totalStored` logic with clear position tracking:
- `currentPosition`: Where we are in history (-1 = initial state)
- `newestPosition`: Newest stored position in buffer
- `availableStates`: Number of states actually stored
- `maxStates`: Maximum buffer size

**Benefits Achieved**:
- Eliminated complex validation logic like `undoSteps < Math.min(totalStored - 1, levels - 1)`
- Clear helper functions: `canUndo()` and `canRedo()`
- Intuitive state representation that matches mental model

#### 3. Separated Rendering Concerns - COMPLETED
**What Changed**: 
- Moved `show()` method from `CircImgCollection` to `UndoLayers`
- Renamed `CircImgCollection` to `ImageCollection` to reflect pure storage role
- `ImageCollection` now purely handles storage with methods: `store()`, `hasImage()`, `getImage()`, `all()`
- All rendering and graphics state management in `UndoLayers.show()`
- Circular buffer navigation logic managed by `UndoLayers`, not storage class

**Benefits Achieved**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- `ImageCollection` is now testable in isolation
- Rendering logic centralized and easier to debug
- **Better naming**: `ImageCollection` accurately reflects its role as simple storage

#### 4. Added State Validation - COMPLETED
**What Added**:
- `validateState()` function with console warnings for invalid states
- Called after all state-changing operations
- Debug helper `_getState()` for development

**Benefits**:
- Early detection of state corruption
- Easier debugging of edge cases
- Prevents silent failures

#### 5. Implementation Decisions Made

**Position Calculation**: Used modulo arithmetic for circular buffer navigation but with clearer logic:
```javascript
// Undo navigation
currentPosition = currentPosition === 0 ? 
  (availableStates < maxStates ? -1 : maxStates - 1) : 
  (currentPosition - 1 + maxStates) % maxStates
```

**Error Handling**: Added comprehensive null checks and graceful degradation when images are missing.

**Backward Compatibility**: Maintained exact same public API (`takeSnapshot()`, `undo()`, `redo()`, `history()`) to ensure no breaking changes.

### Issues Encountered and Resolutions

**Issue 1**: Complex circular buffer logic for initial state (-1 position)
**Resolution**: Added explicit handling for the initial state case where `currentPosition = -1` represents "no history"

**Issue 2**: Position validation with circular buffer wraparound
**Resolution**: Used modulo arithmetic with explicit edge case handling for buffer boundaries

**Issue 3**: Memory management during refactor
**Resolution**: Ensured `layers.dispose()` is still called appropriately in the new `store()` method

**Issue 4**: Undo/redo logic errors in buffer wraparound scenarios - **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: Three test failures in circular buffer behavior were caused by incorrect undo/redo navigation logic.

**Root Cause**: The issue was in the `canUndo()` logic and early returns in the undo method that were preventing valid undo operations from completing.

**Final Resolution**: 
1. **Fixed `canUndo()` logic**: Added proper check for needing at least 2 states to undo
2. **Simplified undo navigation**: Removed overly restrictive early returns that were blocking valid operations  
3. **Consistent circular buffer handling**: Both buffer-full and not-full cases now handle navigation consistently
4. **Improved boundary detection**: Better logic for determining when we've reached the limits of available history

**Test Results**: All tests now pass âœ…
- Buffer wraparound scenarios work correctly
- Edge cases at buffer boundaries handled properly
- Rapid undo/redo sequences function as expected
- State validation prevents corruption

**Issue 5**: Class naming accuracy - **RESOLVED**
**Problem**: `CircImgCollection` name implied it managed circular behavior, but after refactoring it only handles direct position storage.

**Resolution**: Renamed to `ImageCollection` to accurately reflect its role as a simple fixed-size array storage without circular navigation logic.

**Benefits**:
- **Clearer intent**: Name matches functionality
- **Better separation**: Circular logic clearly belongs to `UndoLayers`
- **Reduced confusion**: No implication of circular behavior in storage class

**Issue 6**: File organization and module structure - **COMPLETED**
**Problem**: `undo.layers.js` was located in the root `src/` directory without clear module organization.

**Resolution**: Moved undo system into dedicated `src/undo/` subfolder to improve project organization and follow established patterns.

**Changes Made**:
- Created `src/undo/` directory
- Moved `src/undo.layers.js` â†’ `src/undo/undo.layers.js`
- Moved `src/undo.layers.test.js` â†’ `test/undo.layers.test.js` (to standard test directory)
- Updated import path in `src/sketch.js`
- Updated test import path to `../src/undo/undo.layers.js`
- Updated documentation references in `docs/src/undo/undo.md`

**Benefits**:
- **Better organization**: Undo-related implementation files grouped together
- **Standard test structure**: Tests in conventional `test/` directory
- **Consistent structure**: Follows module organization patterns used elsewhere
- **Future expansion**: Easy to add related undo functionality (e.g., undo.history.js, undo.compression.js)
- **Clearer intent**: Module boundary clearly defined
- **Test discoverability**: Tests in standard location for test runners

### Phase 1 Success Criteria - COMPLETED âœ…
