  Option 3: Drag Handles (Grabbing a Target Point)

   * How it would work: We would draw small handles on the corners and/or edges of the zone's border. The user would click and
     drag these handles to move or resize the zone.
   * Pros:
       * Very Discoverable: The handles would be a clear visual cue that the zone is interactive.
       * Extensible: This pattern can be extended to support resizing and rotation as well.
   * Cons:
       * Implementation Complexity: This is the most complex option to implement. We would need to:
           * Draw the handles on the uiCanvas.
           * Check if the mouse is over a handle in mousePressed.
           * Update the zone's position and/or dimensions in mouseDragged.
       * Visual Clutter: The handles could add some visual clutter to the UI.
