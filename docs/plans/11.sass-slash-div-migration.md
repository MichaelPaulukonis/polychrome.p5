# Plan to Migrate Deprecated Sass Division Syntax

## 1. Objective

The primary goal is to eliminate the "DEPRECATION WARNING [slash-div]" messages that occur during the build process. This involves migrating all instances of the deprecated `/` operator for division in `.scss` files to the modern, recommended `math.div()` function.

This plan follows the official Sass documentation and prioritizes a safe, automated approach.

## 2. Investigation & Analysis

- **Problem:** The Sass compiler warns that using `/` for division is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
- **Example:** `padding-right: ($gutter / 2);`
- **Recommended Fix:** `padding-right: math.div($gutter, 2);`
- **Official Documentation:** The [Sass documentation on the slash-div change](https://sass-lang.com/d/slash-div) strongly recommends using their automated migration tool, `sass-migrator`.

Based on the file `assets/css/base/_grid.scss`, the project uses this deprecated syntax in multiple mixins and style rules. A custom function `safe-divide` also exists, which will be evaluated and potentially refactored separately after the primary migration is complete.

## 3. Proposed Solution: Automated Migration

We will use the official `sass-migrator` tool to perform the migration. This is the safest and most efficient method, as it is designed to handle this specific breaking change, including automatically adding the required `@use "sass:math";` statement to the top of modified files.

## 4. Execution Plan

1.  **Identify Target Files:**
    *   First, a `glob` search will be performed to locate all `.scss` files within the `assets/css/` directory that need to be migrated.

2.  **Run the Sass Migrator:**
    *   The `sass-migrator` will be executed using `npx` to avoid a global installation.
    *   The command `npx sass-migrator division <path-to-file>` will be run for each identified `.scss` file.

3.  **Verification:**
    *   After the migrator has been run on all target files, the project's development server will be started using `npm run dev`.
    *   The build output will be monitored to ensure that all `slash-div` deprecation warnings have been resolved.
    *   A brief visual regression test of the application will be performed to confirm that the UI and layout have not been negatively affected by the changes.

## 5. Contingency Plan (Manual Migration)

If the automated `sass-migrator` tool fails for any reason, the following manual steps will be taken:

1.  **Find & Replace:** A careful, file-by-file search and replace will be performed.
2.  **Update Syntax:** All instances of `($variable / number)` will be manually converted to `math.div($variable, number)`.
3.  **Add Import:** The `@use "sass:math";` statement will be manually added to the top of each file where `math.div()` is used.
4.  **Verification:** The same verification steps from the automated plan will be followed.

This plan will not be executed until it is reviewed and approved.
