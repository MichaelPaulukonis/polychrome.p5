# Plan: Resolve Additional Sass Deprecation Warnings

## 1. Objective

To eliminate all remaining Sass deprecation warnings from the build process. This follows the successful migration of the `slash-div` syntax and addresses the next layer of issues revealed during that process.

The specific warnings to be resolved are:
- `DEPRECATION WARNING [legacy-js-api]`
- `DEPRECATION WARNING [import]`
- `DEPRECATION WARNING [global-builtin]`
- `DEPRECATION WARNING [color-functions]`

## 2. Investigation & Analysis

The build output clearly indicates that while the `slash-div` issue is resolved, several other legacy features are still in use:

1.  **`@import` Rule:** The `@import` rule is deprecated in favor of the more modern and explicit `@use` rule. The Sass documentation provides a migrator for this.
2.  **Global Built-ins:** Functions like `lighten()` and `percentage()` are now namespaced within Sass modules (e.g., `color.lighten()`, `math.percentage()`). The code is using them as global functions.
3.  **Legacy JS API:** This warning is likely related to how Nuxt 2's Webpack configuration for Sass is set up. It may not be directly addressable by changing the Sass code itself, but by updating the build configuration.

## 3. Proposed Solution

A multi-step approach is required to address these distinct issues.

1.  **Migrate from `@import` to `@use`:** Use the official Sass migrator for `@import` rules. This will automatically replace `@import` with `@use` and handle the new module system. This is the highest priority as it will also force the resolution of the global built-in function issue.
2.  **Update Global Functions:** After migrating to `@use`, the compiler will likely throw errors where global functions are used. These will need to be manually updated to use their new, namespaced equivalents (e.g., `math.percentage()`, `color.adjust()`).
3.  **Address Legacy JS API:** This will be investigated separately. It may require changes to `nuxt.config.js` or updating `node-sass`/`sass-loader`. This will be the final step.

## 4. Execution Plan

1.  **Run the `@import` Migrator:**
    *   The command `npx sass-migrator module --migrate-deps .` will be run from the project root. This command will migrate all Sass files in the project from `@import` to `@use`, and will also add dependencies where needed.

2.  **Manually Fix Namespaced Functions:**
    *   After the migrator runs, the build will be run again.
    *   Any errors related to undefined functions (like `percentage` or `lighten`) will be fixed by adding the correct namespace (e.g., `math.percentage`, `color.adjust`). This will likely involve editing `assets/css/utilities/_functions.scss` and `assets/css/base/_grid.scss`.

3.  **Verify and Commit:**
    *   The build will be run one more time to ensure all warnings and errors are gone.
    *   The application will be visually checked to ensure no styles have been broken.
    *   The changes will be committed.

4.  **Investigate Legacy JS API:**
    *   If the `legacy-js-api` warning persists, a separate investigation will be conducted into the project's build dependencies (`nuxt.config.js`, `package.json`). This will be treated as a separate task.

## 5. Contingency Plan

If the automated migrators fail, the `@use` and function changes will be made manually, file by file. This will be more time-consuming but will achieve the same result.

This plan will not be executed until it is reviewed and approved.
