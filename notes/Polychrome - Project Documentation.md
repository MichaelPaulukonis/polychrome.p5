# Polychrome - Project Documentation

## Overview
Polychrome is a creative coding project built with p5.js that explores color interactions and visual generation. The application provides an interactive canvas where users can experience dynamic color compositions through algorithmic art generation.

## Technology Stack
- **p5.js**: Core creative coding library for all visual rendering
- **JavaScript/ES6+**: Primary programming language
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Application structure and styling
- **Local Storage**: For saving user preferences and creations
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes and devices

## Core Features
- Interactive canvas with real-time visual feedback
- Dynamic color palette generation and manipulation
- Particle systems with customizable properties
- Procedural pattern generation
- User controls for adjusting parameters
- Save and export functionality for created artworks

## Visual Style
- Minimalist UI that focuses attention on the canvas
- High contrast between UI elements and generated art
- Fluid animations and transitions between states
- Color theory-based palettes with harmonious relationships

## Interaction Design
- Mouse input for direct manipulation
- Parameter sliders for fine-tuning visual elements
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Responsive controls that work across devices

## Technical Architecture
- Modular component system for separation of concerns
- Event-driven programming model
- Object-oriented design for visual elements
- Frame-based animation loop with performance optimization

## Development Roadmap
