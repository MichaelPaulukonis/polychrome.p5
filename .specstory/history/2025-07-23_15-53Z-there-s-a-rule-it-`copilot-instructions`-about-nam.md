There's a rule it `copilot-instructions` about naming plan files, but we created several plans before this naming convention was added. So there are several plans without a numeric prefix. Let's get those renamed with a prefix like "0A.". There are also plans with a number-prefix followed by a hypen - let's rename those to use a dot instead of a hyphen. When I said "rename" - we should probably use `git mv` instead of purely mv to retain history. I'm open to suggestions if there are better solutions.
