Create a "master.md" file in the "notes" folder that serves as the main project documentation. Structure the file with these sections:

## Overview
Brief description of the project's purpose and goals

## Technology Stack
List all technologies, frameworks, and tools used

## Core Features
Main features and functionality

## Architecture
Project structure and how components interact

## Development Guidelines
Code standards and best practices for this project

## Setup Instructions
How to install and run the project

## Roadmap
Planned features and future improvements

Keep descriptions clear and practical. This document will guide our development decisions.

# Polychrome - Master Documentation

## Overview
Polychrome is a creative coding project built with p5.js that explores color interactions and visual generation. The application provides an interactive canvas where users can experience dynamic color compositions through algorithmic art generation. This project aims to merge aesthetic principles with procedural generation to create unique visual experiences.

## Technology Stack
- **p5.js**: Core creative coding library for all visual rendering
- **JavaScript/ES6+**: Primary programming language
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Application structure and styling
- **Local Storage**: For saving user preferences and creations
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes and devices

## Core Features
- Interactive canvas with real-time visual feedback
- Dynamic color palette generation and manipulation
- Particle systems with customizable properties
- Procedural pattern generation
- User controls for adjusting parameters
- Save and export functionality for created artworks

## Architecture
- **Modular Component System**: Separation of concerns with independent modules
- **Event-Driven Model**: Utilizing p5.js event system for user interactions
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Encapsulating visual elements as objects
- **Frame-Based Animation Loop**: Core rendering cycle with performance optimizations
- **File Structure**:
  - `/src`: Source code
  - `/assets`: Images, fonts, and other static assets
  - `/lib`: Third-party libraries
  - `/styles`: CSS styling
  - `/utils`: Utility functions and helpers

## Development Guidelines
- **Code Style**: Follow JavaScript Standard Style guidelines
- **Documentation**: Document all functions and complex code sections
- **Naming Conventions**: Use camelCase for variables and functions
- **Testing**: Test visual components manually on different devices/browsers
- **Performance**: Optimize render loops and minimize DOM operations
- **Git Workflow**: Create feature branches for new functionality
- **Code Reviews**: Required for all pull requests before merging

## Setup Instructions
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Node.js (latest LTS version)
   - npm or yarn package manager

2. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/polychrome.p5.git
   cd polychrome.p5
   npm install
   ```

3. **Running Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

4. **Building for Production**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Roadmap
### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Basic canvas setup and drawing functionality
- Color palette implementation
- Simple shape generation

### Phase 2: Core Experience
- Advanced pattern algorithms
- User interface implementation
- Parameter controls

### Phase 3: Polish & Extensions
- Performance optimization
- Export and sharing capabilities
- Additional visual effects and modes

### Future Enhancements
- Community gallery for sharing creations
- Audio reactivity and sound generation
- Mobile application version
- Integration with other creative coding libraries
```
