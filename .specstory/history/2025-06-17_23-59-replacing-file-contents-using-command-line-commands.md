# Replacing file contents using command line commands (2025-06-17 19:59:25)

_**User**_

I have 2 files - consolidated-documentation.md and master.md. I want to replace the contents of master with the contents of consolidated - should I just copy-n-paste, git rm the old file, and commit? Or is there a command-line-only solution?

You can do this entirely from the command line without manually copying and pasting. Here are a couple of options:

## Option 1: Simple copy (recommended)
```bash
cp consolidated-documentation.md master.md
git add master.md
git commit -m "Replace master.md with consolidated documentation"
```

## Option 2: Using git mv if you want to preserve git history
```bash
git mv master.md master-old.md
git mv consolidated-documentation.md master.md
git rm master-old.md
git commit -m "Replace master.md with consolidated documentation"
```

## Option 3: If you want to keep both files but replace content
```bash
cat consolidated-documentation.md > master.md
git add master.md
git commit -m "Replace master.md content with consolidated documentation"
```

**Option 1 is the simplest and most straightforward** - it replaces the content while preserving the filename and git will automatically detect it as a modification to the existing file, maintaining some history context.

The `git rm` approach you mentioned would work but is unnecessarily complex since you're keeping the same filename.
