# Ignoring changes in a specific folder for npm version (2025-07-23 16:34Z)

_**User (2025-07-23 16:37Z)**_

I'm using SpecStory - as VS Code extension that saves copilot chat history into a folder called .specstory. I have this included for git - it is not ignored because I want to preserve this history. But When I attempt to publish, `npm version patch` complains that the working directory is not clean, due to recent saves to specstory.

Without adding .specstory to .gitignore, can I get `npm version` to ignore this folder?

Here is an exmplae of me trying to publish after specstory updated some history:

(base) ➜  polychrome.p5 git:(main) ✗ npm run publish

> polychrome.p5@1.2.0 publish
> npm run bump && DEPLOY_ENV=GH_PAGES npm run generate && npm run deploy


> polychrome.p5@1.2.0 bump
> npm version patch

npm error Git working directory not clean.
npm error A complete log of this run can be found in: /Users/michaelpaulukonis/.npm/_logs/2025-07-23T16_34_13_361Z-debug-0.log

`npm version` requires a clean working directory by default—it checks for *any* changes, including those in tracked folders like ``. There is **no built-in way** to tell `npm version` to ignore changes in specific folders if those folders are tracked by git.

### Your options:

1. **Commit or stash `` changes before running `npm version patch`:**
   - Commit:  
     ```sh
     git add .specstory
     git commit -m "chore(specstory): update chat history"
     npm run publish
     ```
   - Or stash:  
     ```sh
     git stash push .specstory
     npm run publish
     git stash pop
     ```

2. **Use `--force` (not recommended):**
   - You can run:  
     ```sh
     npm version patch --force
     ```
   - But this is risky—it will bump the version even with uncommitted changes, which can lead to inconsistent releases.

3. **Automate with a pre-publish script:**  
   Add a script to auto-commit `` before publishing.

   Example:
   ````sh
   // Add to package.json scripts:
   "prepublish:specstory": "git add .specstory && git commit -m 'chore(specstory): auto-commit before publish' || true"
   // Then update your publish script:
   "publish": "npm run prepublish:specstory && npm run bump && DEPLOY_ENV=GH_PAGES npm run generate && npm run deploy"
   ````

**Summary:**  
You must commit, stash, or remove changes in `` before running `npm version patch`. There is no way to make `npm version` ignore tracked changes in specific folders.
