# Context usage of .github/instructions.md file (2025-06-18 00:05Z)

_**User**_

Do you always use the context of .github/instructions.md ?

---

_**Assistant**_

No, I don't automatically use the context of `instructions.md` unless you specifically ask me to reference it or if it's relevant to the task at hand.

I have access to your workspace files, but I only reference specific files when:
- You explicitly ask about them
- They're directly relevant to answering your question
- You're working with code that would benefit from understanding project-specific instructions

If you'd like me to review your `instructions.md` file to understand project-specific guidelines or context, just let me know and I can incorporate that information into my responses.

This is an instructions file for github copilot. Should it be renamed, or is there a VS Code setting I need to update?

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on the GitHub Copilot settings, there are two ways to handle instructions files:

1. **Use the default `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file** - This is automatically recognized when the **github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles** setting is enabled.

2. **Configure custom instruction files** - You can specify custom file paths in the various Copilot instruction settings.

If your file is named differently than `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, you have two options:

**Option 1: Rename your file to the default name**
Rename your instructions file to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and ensure the setting is enabled:

```
{
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles": "true"
}
``` 2: Configure your custom file in the relevant instruction settings**
For example, if you want to use your custom instructions file for code generation, configure it like this:

```
{
  "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": "[{\"file\": \"your-instructions-filename.md\"}]"
}
``` can also configure instructions for other Copilot features using **github.copilot.chat.testGeneration.instructions**, **github.copilot.chat.commitMessageGeneration.instructions**, **github.copilot.chat.reviewSelection.instructions**, or **github.copilot.chat.pullRequestDescriptionGeneration.instructions**.
