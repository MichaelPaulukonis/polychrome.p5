_**Assistant**_

I'll list the allowed directories that the filesystem MCP server can access. The filesystem MCP server is currently configured to only allow access to the `/app` directory. This means you can only read, write, and manipulate files within that specific directory path using the MCP filesystem tools.

If you need to access files in your current workspace (``) or other directories, you would need to use the regular VS Code tools instead of the MCP filesystem tools, or the MCP server configuration would need to be updated to include those directories in the allowed list.

The MCP server for filesystem access is runnning within Docker. I need to configure it to be allowed access to /Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects (outside of the container)

---

_**Assistant**_

To configure the MCP filesystem server running in Docker to access `` on your host machine, you'll need to set up a volume mount. Here are the steps:

## Option 1: Modify Docker Run Command

If you're running the container with `docker run`, add a volume mount:

```bash
docker run -v /Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects:/app/projects your-mcp-image
```

This maps your host directory `` to `/app/projects` inside the container.

## Option 2: Update Docker Compose

If you're using Docker Compose, update your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  mcp-filesystem:
    image: your-mcp-image
    volumes:
      - /Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects:/app/projects
    # ... other configuration
```

## Option 3: Mount to Root Path

If you want the MCP server to access the exact path structure, you could mount it directly:

```bash
docker run -v /Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects:/Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects your-mcp-image
```

However, this requires updating the MCP server configuration to allow `` instead of just `/app`.

## MCP Server Configuration

You may also need to update the MCP server's allowed directories configuration. This is typically done through:

1. **Environment variables** in the container
2. **Configuration file** that specifies allowed paths
3. **Command line arguments** when starting the MCP server

The exact method depends on how your MCP filesystem server is implemented. Look for configuration options like:
- `ALLOWED_DIRECTORIES`
- `--allowed-paths`
- A config file with directory permissions

Would you like me to help you check your current Docker configuration or MCP server setup to determine the exact changes needed?

list allowed directories

_**Assistant**_

I'll check the allowed directories for the MCP filesystem server. The MCP filesystem server is still only configured to allow access to the `/app` directory. This means the Docker volume mount configuration hasn't been updated yet, or the MCP server configuration needs to be modified to include additional allowed directories.

To resolve this, you'll need to:

1. **Update the Docker container** with a volume mount to map your host directory to the container
2. **Configure the MCP server** to allow access to the mounted directory

The current allowed directory is still just `/app`, so any volume mounts you add will need to be mapped to paths under `/app` or the MCP server configuration needs to be updated to allow additional root paths.

Settings.json contains the "filesystem" config for this MCP server. I'm not vdry familiar with docker configuration - is there something wrong with how I have defined the filepaths? That path is on my main machine, not in the container. The main machine is the host, correct?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me take a look at your VS Code settings.json file to see how you've configured the MCP filesystem server. Let me see the rest of the filesystem configuration: I can see the issue! Your Docker volume mount is correct - you're properly mapping your host directory `` to the same path inside the container. However, the MCP filesystem server is only allowing access to `/app` directory.

The problem is that the MCP filesystem server container is configured by default to only allow access to `/app`, but you're mounting your directory to `` inside the container.

Here are two solutions:

## Solution 1: Mount to `/app` (Recommended)
Change your volume mount to map to `/app` inside the container: 
```

```
## Solution 2: Configure Additional Allowed Directories
Alternatively, you could configure the MCP server to allow additional directories by passing environment variables or arguments. You would add something like:

```json
"--volume=/Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects:/Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects",
"-e", "ALLOWED_DIRECTORIES=/app,/Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects",
```

But Solution 1 is simpler and more standard.

**To summarize the issue:**
- Yes, your host machine path (``) was correct
- The Docker volume mount syntax was correct
- The problem was that you were mounting to `` inside the container, but the MCP server only allows access to `/app`
- By mounting to `/app` instead, your host directory will be accessible to the MCP server

After making this change, restart VS Code or reload the MCP servers, and then your filesystem MCP server should be able to access your projects directory.

Hrm. Now we're having an error on start:

_**Assistant**_

The error indicates that the Docker container is trying to execute `./server` but can't find it. This suggests the MCP filesystem server container might need additional configuration or the image might have a different entrypoint.

Let's try a few solutions:

## Solution 1: Let the container use its default entrypoint

Remove any implicit command override by not specifying a working directory: 
```

```
I changed the mount point to `/app/projects` so it's under the allowed `/app` directory but doesn't override the entire `/app` directory where the server executable might be located.

## If that doesn't work, try Solution 2: Add the working directory 
```

```
The issue was likely that by mounting your directory to `/app`, you were overriding the container's `/app` directory where the server executable is located. By mounting to `/app/projects` instead, we preserve the server executable while still making your projects accessible.

Try restarting the MCP server now. If it still doesn't work, let me know and we can try a different approach or check if there's a different image or configuration needed.

Okay, the filesystem server has now started and is running.

Please list available directories.

---

_**Assistant**_

Great! Now that the filesystem server is running, let me check what directories are available. Perfect! The MCP filesystem server is now running and allowing access to the `/app` directory. Since we mounted your `` directory to `/app/projects` inside the container, your projects should now be accessible at `/app/projects`.

Let me list the contents of the `/app` directory to see what's available: Excellent! Now I can see that:

1. The `/app/projects` directory is mounted and accessible (this contains your host machine's ``)
2. The `/app/server` file is the MCP server executable

Let me also show you what's inside your projects directory: Perfect! ðŸŽ‰ The MCP filesystem server is now working correctly and has access to all your projects. I can see:

- **Your polychrome.p5 project** at `/app/projects/polychrome.p5` (which corresponds to your workspace ``)
- Many other interesting projects like meme generators, image processing tools, p5.js sketches, and more

The configuration is now working properly:
- âœ… MCP filesystem server is running
- âœ… Volume mount is correctly mapping `` to `/app/projects`
- âœ… Server has access to the allowed directory `/app`
- âœ… All your projects are accessible through the MCP filesystem tools

You can now use the MCP filesystem tools to read, write, and manipulate files in any of these project directories!
