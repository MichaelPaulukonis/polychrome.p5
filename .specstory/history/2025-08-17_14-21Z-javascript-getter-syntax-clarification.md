# JavaScript getter syntax clarification (2025-08-17 14:21Z)

_**User**_

Is this now a normal way to pass in a string to a signature? `get AppMode()` looks weird to me

---

_**Assistant**_

No, this is not a "normal" way to pass a string to a function. The syntax:

```javascript
get appMode() { return pct.appMode }
```

is using a JavaScript getter property, not a string. In the context of the object passed to `createGammaAdjustment`, this defines a property `appMode` that, when accessed, will return the current value of `pct.appMode`.

This pattern is sometimes used to provide a dynamic, up-to-date value (not a static string or value) to a function or module that may need to read the latest state at any time. It's not the most common pattern, but it is valid and can be useful when you want to pass a "live" reference to a value rather than a snapshot.

If the function expects a string, you should just pass `appMode: pct.appMode`. If it expects a getter, this pattern is intentional. If you want to clarify or simplify, you could pass a function instead:

```javascript
appMode: () => pct.appMode
```

But the getter property is a valid, though less common, approach.

What is the difference between `git add .` and `git add -A` ?

---

_**Assistant**_

The difference between `git add .` and `git add -A` is in **what files they stage for commit**:

- **`git add .`**  
  Stages **new and modified files** in the current directory and its subdirectories, but **does not stage deletions** (removed files are not staged for commit).

- **`git add -A`**  
  Stages **all changes** in the repository:  
  - New files  
  - Modified files  
  - **Deleted files** (removals)

**Summary:**  
- Use `git add .` to stage only new/modified files in the current directory.
- Use `git add -A` to stage **all changes** (including deletions) across the entire repo.

For most workflows, `git add -A` is safer to ensure nothing is missed, especially file deletions.
