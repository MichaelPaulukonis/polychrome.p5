# JavaScript getter syntax clarification (2025-08-17 14:21Z)

_**User**_

Is this now a normal way to pass in a string to a signature? `get AppMode()` looks weird to me

_**Assistant**_

No, this is not a "normal" way to pass a string to a function. The syntax:

```javascript
get appMode() { return pct.appMode }
```

is using a JavaScript getter property, not a string. In the context of the object passed to `createGammaAdjustment`, this defines a property `appMode` that, when accessed, will return the current value of `pct.appMode`.

This pattern is sometimes used to provide a dynamic, up-to-date value (not a static string or value) to a function or module that may need to read the latest state at any time. It's not the most common pattern, but it is valid and can be useful when you want to pass a "live" reference to a value rather than a snapshot.

If the function expects a string, you should just pass `appMode: pct.appMode`. If it expects a getter, this pattern is intentional. If you want to clarify or simplify, you could pass a function instead:

```javascript
appMode: () => pct.appMode
```

But the getter property is a valid, though less common, approach.
