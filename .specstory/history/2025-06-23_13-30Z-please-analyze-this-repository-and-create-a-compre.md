- **Creative Coding**: p5.js 1.11.8 for canvas rendering and visual effects
- **Language**: JavaScript ES6+ (with ongoing TypeScript migration)
- **Build Tools**: Webpack (via Nuxt), Vitest for testing
- **Styling**: SCSS, CSS3, some utility patterns
- **State Management**: Client-side localStorage for persistence
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages via gh-pages

### **Project Type**
Interactive creative coding web application focused on text-based visual art generation.

### **Target Audience**
- Digital artists and creative coders
- Typography enthusiasts

- Generative art practitioners

### **Current Status**
Mature development project (v1.0.67) with active maintenance and ongoing refactoring. Production-ready with comprehensive testing suite.

## 2. Architecture Summary

### **Overall Architecture**
Modular creative coding application built on p5.js with sophisticated multi-layer canvas management, featuring:

- **Multi-Canvas System**: Main display canvas + drawing layer + temporary operations layer
- **Factory Pattern**: Dependency injection for drawing modes, color systems, and canvas transforms
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: p5.js lifecycle (`setup()`, `draw()`) with user interaction callbacks
- **Modular Component System**: Separated concerns across specialized modules

### **Key Components**
1. **Canvas Management** (`layers.js`): Multi-layer rendering system
2. **Drawing Modes** (``): Grid, Circle, RowCol text layout engines
3. **Color System** (``): HSB-based color generation with multiple paint algorithms
4. **Text Management** (``): Font loading, rendering, and character generation
5. **Canvas Transforms** (``): Rotation, mirroring, shifting operations
6. **GUI System** (``): Parameter controls and user interaction
7. **Undo System** (``): Circular buffer-based state management
8. **Scripting Engine** (``): Recording and playback of user actions

### **Data Flow**
```
User Input → GUI Parameters → Drawing Modes → Color System → Canvas Layers → Visual Output
     ↓                                                              ↑
Recording System ←→ Undo System ←→ State Management ←→ Canvas Transforms
```

### **External Dependencies**
- **p5.js**: Core creative coding library
- **Vue.js/Nuxt.js**: Application framework
- **Ramda**: Functional programming utilities
- **file-saver**: Canvas export functionality
- **hotkeys-js**: Keyboard interaction
- **No external APIs or databases**

### **Design Patterns**
- **Factory Pattern**: Creating drawing modes and color systems with dependency injection
- **Module Pattern**: Encapsulated functionality with clean interfaces
- **Observer Pattern**: Parameter changes triggering visual updates
- **Command Pattern**: Action recording and macro system

## 8. Technical Debt and Improvements

### **Code Quality Issues**
1. **Mixed Coding Paradigms**: Self-acknowledged "horrible mish-mash" of procedural, functional, and OOP code
2. **Global State Management**: Some components still rely on global variables
3. **GUI Integration**: QuickSettings wrapper requires global variables, limiting modularity

### **Performance Concerns**
1. **Multiple Canvas Management**: Three canvases may impact performance on mobile devices
2. **Large Font Collection**: 100+ fonts could affect initial load time
3. **Pixel Density**: Retina/high-DPI support needs optimization
4. **Memory Management**: Undo system with image data could consume significant memory

### **Security Considerations**
- **Minimal Security Concerns**: No authentication, external APIs, or sensitive data
- **Client-Side Only**: All data remains on user's device
- **Font Loading**: Local font files present minimal security risk

### **Scalability Issues**
1. **Large Canvas Support**: Performance degradation with very large canvases
2. **Animation Export**: Manual frame stitching process for video creation
3. **Mobile Support**: Touch interaction and responsive design needs improvement

### **Dependency Management**
- **Outdated Dependencies**: Many packages significantly behind current versions
- **Framework Migration**: Nuxt 2 → 3 upgrade needed
- **p5.js Version**: p5.js 2.0 available but not yet adopted

## 9. Project Health Metrics

### **Code Complexity**: **Medium-High**
- Well-modularized but some legacy complexity
- Ongoing refactoring improving architecture

### **Test Coverage**: **Good**
- 89 tests across core functionality
- 93% of tests passing with good coverage of critical paths

### **Documentation Coverage**: **Excellent**
- Comprehensive internal documentation
- AI-assisted development guidelines
- Missing only user-facing documentation

### **Maintainability Score**: **Good**
- Clear module boundaries
- Dependency injection patterns
- Comprehensive refactoring plans in place

### **Technical Debt Level**: **Medium**
- Acknowledged legacy code issues
- Active refactoring in progress
- Clear improvement roadmap

## 10. Recommendations and Next Steps
