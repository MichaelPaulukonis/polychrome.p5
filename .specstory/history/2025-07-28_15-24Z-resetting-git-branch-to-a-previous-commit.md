# Resetting Git branch to a previous commit (2025-07-28 15:24Z)

_**User**_

I've made a couple of git commits to a branch. I want to remove them (c386f10, d9ce7b6), go back to a specific one (343400e). What are the git commands I can execute to do this? Do not take action, just tell me what to do.

_**Assistant**_

To remove the last two commits and reset your branch to commit `343400e`, use the following command in your terminal:

```
git reset --hard 343400e
```

**Notes:**
- This will permanently remove commits `c386f10` and `d9ce7b6` from your branch history.
- Any uncommitted changes will also be lost.
- If you have already pushed these commits to a remote, you will need to force-push:
  ```
  git push --force
  ```
- Always double-check before using `--hard` and `--force` as these actions cannot be undone.
