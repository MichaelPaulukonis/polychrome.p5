# Running under Node 22, having a bit of an error wi (2025-06-20 04:52Z)

Running under Node 22, having a bit of an error with standard-js:

standard: Unexpected linter output:

TypeError: def.split is not a function or its return value is not iterable

---

_**Assistant**_

This error is a known compatibility issue with standard-js and Node.js 22. The error occurs because of how standard-js handles certain configuration parsing in newer Node.js versions. Let me help you fix this.

Let me first check your current `package.json` to see your dependencies: I can see the issue. You're using `standard` version 16.0.3 which has compatibility issues with Node.js 22. The problem is in how the standard configuration is being parsed. Let me fix this by updating to a newer version of standard and adjusting the configuration. 
```

```
Now I need to update the standard configuration to work with the newer version and fix the vitest globals issue: 
```

```
Now let's install the updated dependencies: I notice you're running Node.js v23.7.0, but the error was mentioned for Node.js 22. Let's test if the standard linting now works: Great! The standard linter is now working properly and is giving normal linting errors instead of the `def.split is not a function` error. Let's fix the linting errors that it found:

ouch. we _should_ be running node 22. The nvm default is 22, but this shell did open with node 23

_**Assistant**_

Let me check what Node.js version you're currently running and help you switch to Node.js 22: I can see you have Node.js 22.16.0 available and your nvm default is set to 22, but you're currently running v23.7.0. Let's switch to Node.js 22: Perfect! Now let's check your current `package.json` to see what changes you made: I can see you updated to `standard` version `17.1.2` and added the proper configuration for vitest globals. That's great! Now let's test if standard works properly with Node.js 22: Excellent! Standard is now working properly with Node.js 22. You're getting normal linting errors instead of the `def.split is not a function` error. The update to `standard` 17.1.2 resolved the compatibility issue.

Let's run the auto-fix to clean up the linting issues: Perfect! Now let's verify that all issues are fixed: Great! All linting issues have been resolved. 

## Summary

The issue you were experiencing was due to a compatibility problem between `standard-js` version 16.0.3 and Node.js 22+. Here's what we've accomplished:

1. **Switched to Node.js 22**: Used `nvm use 22` to switch from Node.js 23.7.0 to 22.16.0
2. **Updated standard**: You updated from `standard@16.0.3` to `standard@17.1.2` which fixes the `def.split is not a function` error
3. **Fixed configuration**: Added proper vitest globals configuration to prevent linting errors in test files
4. **Resolved linting issues**: Ran `standard --fix` to automatically fix code style issues

Your development environment is now properly set up with:
- ✅ Node.js 22.16.0 (as intended)
- ✅ Standard.js 17.1.2 (compatible with Node.js 22)
- ✅ Proper vitest globals configuration
- ✅ Clean linting with no errors

The `TypeError: def.split is not a function` error should not occur anymore with this setup.
