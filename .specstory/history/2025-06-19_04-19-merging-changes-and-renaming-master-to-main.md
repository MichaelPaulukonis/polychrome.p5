I want to merge in all of my changes to the master branch. then rename the master branch to 'main'. What steps do I need to take?

Here are the steps to merge your changes to master and rename it to main:

## Step 1: Ensure you're on master and it's up to date
```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```

## Step 2: Merge your current branch into master
If you're currently on a feature branch:
```bash
# First, make sure your current branch is committed
git add .
git commit -m "feat: final changes before merge to master"

# Switch to master and merge
git checkout master
git merge your-feature-branch-name
```

If you want to merge without switching branches first:
```bash
git checkout master
git merge -
```
(The `-` refers to the previous branch you were on)

## Step 3: Push the merged changes to master
```bash
git push origin master
```

## Step 4: Rename master to main locally
```bash
git branch -m master main
```

## Step 5: Push the new main branch and set upstream
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 6: Update the default branch on GitHub
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **General** → **Default branch**
3. Change the default branch from `master` to `main`
4. Click **Update**

## Step 7: Delete the old master branch (optional but recommended)
```bash
# Delete the remote master branch
git push origin --delete master

# Clean up any remaining references
git remote prune origin
```

## Step 8: Update any local clones
For any other local clones of this repository, run:
```bash
git checkout master
git branch -m master main
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/main main
git remote set-head origin -a
```

After these steps, your repository will use `main` as the default branch with all your changes merged in.
