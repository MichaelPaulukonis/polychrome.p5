_**Assistant**_

I need some clarification before creating the params.md documentation:

1. **Undo System Reference**: You mentioned "undo system params.js" but the provided `params.js` file doesn't contain undo-related parameters. Should I:
   - Document the current `params.js` file as-is?
   - Wait for you to provide the undo system files?
   - Look for undo-related parameters that might be missing from the current file?

2. **Additional Files**: You mentioned "any other files that need to be referenced" - should I focus only on the `params.js` file provided, or do you have other parameter-related files you'd like me to include in this documentation?

3. **Scope Clarification**: Should this documentation cover:
   - Just the parameter structure and types?
   - Parameter relationships and dependencies?
   - How parameters integrate with the drawing modes and color systems?
   - All of the above?

Please clarify these points so I can create the most useful documentation for AI-assisted development.
