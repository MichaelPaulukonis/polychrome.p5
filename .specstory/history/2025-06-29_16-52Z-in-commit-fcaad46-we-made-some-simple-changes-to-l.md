# In commit fcaad46 we made some simple changes to l (2025-06-29 16:52Z)

In commit fcaad46 we made some simple changes to layers.js. Although all tests passed, it turns out there is a error when running the app and the canvas never appears. The error does not exist on the previous commit 1e09eed. There have been no changes to src/layers.js since the commit, so although there are intervening commits we don't need to go back and rewrite history when this is fixed.

Here is the error in the web console:

Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'resizeCanvas')
    at clear (sketch.js:305:1)
    at Object.clearCanvas (sketch.js:299:1)
    at Sketch.p5.setup (sketch.js:114:1)
    at p5._setup (p5.js:66273:25)
    at p5._runIfPreloadsAreDone (p5.js:66219:27)
    at p5._decrementPreload (p5.js:66230:25)
    at img.onload (p5.js:94691:22)

Let's get this fixed and working.

I need to investigate this issue. The error suggests that `resizeCanvas` is being called on an undefined object. Let me first examine the current state of the layers.js file and then look at the sketch.js file to understand the error. Now I can see the issue! The error is in the `clear` function at line 305. It's calling `layer.resizeCanvas()` on what could be the p5 instance (main canvas) or a p5.Graphics object. However, p5.Graphics objects don't have a `resizeCanvas` method - only the main p5 instance does.

Let me look at the commit history to understand what changed: Now I understand the issue! The problem is in the `renderTarget` function in `sketch.js` at line 291. It's still trying to access `layers.p5` but we renamed that property to `layers.p5instance` in the layers.js file.

Let me check if there are other references to `layers.p5` in sketch.js: Perfect! I found all the references to `layers.p5` that need to be updated to `layers.p5instance`. Let me fix these one by one:

Now let me also check if there are any similar references in other files: Let me check for any current references in the active codebase:
