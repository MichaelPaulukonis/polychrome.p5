# sketch.js is too large and needs to have more code (2025-06-20 03:32Z)

_**User**_

sketch.js is too large and needs to have more code extracted into modules, like we did with color-system. Functions like `rotateCanvas`, `flip`, `mirror`, `shift`, and `adjustGamma` seem like they could form a "canvas transforms" module. Of secondary concern is testability of the extracted functions.

First, explain your plan to me. Then ask any questions you might have.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you refactor the large `sketch.js` file by extracting canvas transform functions into a separate module. Let me first examine the current code structure and then explain my plan. Now let me examine the current color-system module to understand the pattern: Now let me look at the directory structure to see where to place the new module: Perfect! Now I have a clear understanding of the codebase structure and the transform functions that need to be extracted. Here's my plan:

## Refactoring Plan: Canvas Transforms Module

### **Overview**
I'll extract the canvas transformation functions from `sketch.js` into a new module called `canvas-transforms.js` following the same pattern used for the `color-system.js` module.

### **Functions to Extract**
1. **`rotateCanvas`** - Rotates canvas 90 degrees with dimension swapping
2. **`flip`** + **`flipCore`** - Flips canvas horizontally or vertically
3. **`mirror`** + **`mirrorCore`** - Creates mirrored half-images
4. **`shift`** - Shifts pixels with wrapping using ImageData API
5. **`newCorner`** - Utility for corner rotation (currently unused but related)

### **Module Design**
- **Factory Function Pattern**: Create `createCanvasTransforms(dependencies)` that returns an object with transform functions
- **Dependency Injection**: Pass in required dependencies like `layers`, `recordAction`, `globals`, `renderLayers`, `APP_MODES`, etc.
- **Pure Functions**: Extract core transformation logic (`flipCore`, `mirrorCore`) as pure functions for easy testing
- **Constants**: Export `HORIZONTAL` and `VERTICAL` constants

### **Testability Improvements**
1. **Pure Functions**: `flipCore` and `mirrorCore` will be pure functions that take graphics objects and return transformed versions
2. **Mocked Dependencies**: The factory pattern allows easy mocking of p5.js, layers, and recording systems
3. **Isolated Logic**: Canvas manipulation logic separated from sketch-specific concerns

### **File Structure**
```
src/
  canvas-transforms/
    index.js          # Main factory function and public API
    core-transforms.js # Pure transformation functions
    canvas-transforms.js # Main implementation
```

### **Integration Points**
- Import the factory function in `sketch.js`
- Initialize with required dependencies in `setup()`
- Replace existing function calls with the new module's methods
- Update the `pct` object exports to use the new module

### **Benefits**
1. **Reduced `sketch.js` size** - Remove ~150 lines of transformation code
2. **Better testability** - Pure functions can be tested in isolation
3. **Reusability** - Transform functions could be used by other modules
4. **Consistency** - Following the same pattern as `color-system.js`
5. **Maintainability** - Transform logic grouped in logical module

## Questions for You

1. **Module Structure**: Do you prefer a single file (`canvas-transforms.js`) or would you like me to split it into multiple files like `core-transforms.js` for pure functions and `canvas-transforms.js` for the main factory?

2. **Testing Priority**: Should I focus on making all functions testable, or prioritize extracting the code first and add comprehensive tests in a follow-up?

3. **Dependency Management**: The `adjustGamma` function is already extracted to `color-system.js` but used here. Should I leave it there or move it to the transforms module since it's a canvas transformation?

4. **Naming Convention**: Do you prefer `createCanvasTransforms` or `createTransformFunctions` for the factory function name?

5. **Constants Location**: Should the `HORIZONTAL`/`VERTICAL` constants be exported from the transforms module or kept in a shared constants file?

Let me know your preferences and I'll proceed with the implementation!

1. multiple files
2. prioritize extracting code first
3. Leave where it is. It's more color-related, but it is debateable.
4. createCanvasTransorms
5. exported from the module (although I'm open to hearing arguments otherwise)

Let's go!

---

_**Assistant**_

Perfect! Let's get started with the refactoring. I'll create the canvas transforms module with multiple files and extract the code first.

## Step 1: Create the module directory structure ## Step 2: Create the core transforms module with pure functions ## Step 3: Create the main canvas transforms module ## Step 4: Create the index file for the public API ## Step 5: Update `sketch.js` to use the new module

Now I'll modify `sketch.js` to import and use the new canvas transforms module, and remove the old functions. 
```

```
Now let's add the initialization of the canvas transforms in the setup function: 
```

```
Now let's remove the old transform function definitions. First, let me find where they are: Perfect! Now I'll remove the old transform functions and replace them with references to the new module. Let me remove the constants and functions from lines 647 onwards: Now let me continue reading to find where the shift function ends: Now let me find where the `newCorner` and `rotateCanvas` functions are: Perfect! Now I need to remove all the old transform functions and replace them with references to the new module. Let me remove the large block of old functions: 
```

```
Now let me remove the `newCorner` and `rotateCanvas` functions: 
```

```
Now I need to update the end of the file where the `pct` object is being populated with the transform functions. Let me find that section: Let me search for the pct assignments: Perfect! Now I need to update these assignments to use the new canvas transforms. Let me replace the transform-related assignments: 
```

```
Now I need to update the constants assignments: 
```

```
## Step 6: Test that the refactoring doesn't break anything

Let me run the application to make sure everything still works: I need to run in development mode instead: Great! Let me wait for it to finish building: It looks like it's still building. Let me check if there are any compilation errors now: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

mmmm. error in the browser-console:

Uncaught (in promise) ReferenceError: canvasTransforms is not defined
    at new Sketch (sketch.js:756:1)
    at builder (index.vue:114:1)
    at new p5 (p5.js:66504:15)
    at eval (index.vue:128:1)
    at <anonymous>

---

_**Assistant**_

I need to check the current state of the files to understand why `canvasTransforms` is not defined. Let me examine the relevant files. I need to diagnose this `canvasTransforms is not defined` error. Let me first check the current state of the files to understand what changes were made and then identify the issue. Now let me check the relevant parts of `sketch.js` to see how `canvasTransforms` is being initialized and used: Let me check where `canvasTransforms` is declared and used to identify the scoping issue: I can see the issue! The `canvasTransforms` variable is declared inside the `setup` function (line 88), but it's being used outside of that function scope when populating the `pct` object (around lines 756-779). The `pct` object assignment seems to happen outside the `setup` function, so `canvasTransforms` is not in scope.

Let me check where the `pct` object assignments are happening: Perfect! I can see the issue clearly now. The `pct` object assignments that reference `canvasTransforms` are happening outside the `setup` function (around lines 756-779), but `canvasTransforms` is declared inside the `setup` function (line 88). This means `canvasTransforms` is not in scope when these assignments happen.

I need to fix this by either:
1. Moving the `canvasTransforms` initialization outside of `setup` 
2. Moving the `pct` assignments inside `setup`

Let me check the structure more carefully to understand the best approach: I can see that `canvasTransforms` needs to be available at the module level for the `pct` object assignments. The best approach is to declare `canvasTransforms` at the module level (like `colorSystem` and `adjustGamma`) and initialize it in the `setup` function.

Let me check where other variables like `colorSystem` are being declared and used: Perfect! I can see the pattern. `colorSystem` is declared at the module level (line 31) and then initialized inside the `setup` function (line 75). I need to follow the same pattern for `canvasTransforms`.

Let me fix this: 
```

```
Now I need to change the declaration inside `setup` from `const canvasTransforms =` to just `canvasTransforms =`: 
```

```
Now let me test the application to see if this fixes the error: 

---

_**User**_

sketch.js:757 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'flip')
    at new Sketch (sketch.js:757:1)
    at builder (index.vue:114:1)
    at new p5 (p5.js:66504:15)
    at eval (index.vue:128:1)
    at <anonymous>

  canvasTransforms is declared, but is only instantiated in p5.setup, which is run _after_ the assignments at lines #750+

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue! The `canvasTransforms` variable is declared but only gets instantiated inside `p5.setup()`, which runs after the `pct` object assignments. The `pct` object is being populated immediately when the `Sketch` function is called, but `setup()` hasn't run yet, so `canvasTransforms` is still `undefined`.

I need to move the `pct` object assignments into the `setup()` function or restructure this differently. Let me examine the current structure and fix this: I can see that `setupCallback(pct)` is called at the end of the `setup()` function. This means I should move the canvas transforms assignments into the `setup()` function right before this callback, or I should modify the approach.

Let me move the transform-related `pct` assignments into the `setup()` function, right before the `setupCallback(pct)` call: 
```

```
Now I need to remove the canvas transforms assignments from the end of the file where they're currently causing the error: Now I need to remove all the canvas transforms assignments from this section and keep only the non-transform related assignments: 
```

```

```

```

```

```
Now let me test if this fixes the issue by checking the development server: I see the issue! The problem is that `canvasTransforms` is being used in the global scope assignments (around lines 750+) before it's actually instantiated in the `setup()` function. Let me examine the current state and fix this. I can see the issue. The transform functions that were previously assigned to `pct` at the global level have been removed, but we need to make sure they're properly assigned inside the `setup()` function after `canvasTransforms` is instantiated. Let me check where the `setup()` function ends to see if the transform assignments are missing: Great! I can see that the transform functions are properly being assigned to the `pct` object inside the `setup()` function after `canvasTransforms` is instantiated. Let me check if there's a `rotateWrapped` function that we might have missed in our transform module: I notice that `rotateWrapped` is being assigned but I don't see it in our transforms module. Let me search for it in the original code to see what it was: It seems like `rotateWrapped` was probably another function that we should have included. Let me check if there are any other git changes or if we can search for the original function. But first, let me check what functions our canvas transforms module actually exports: I can see that `rotateWrapped` is in the return object, but let me check if the function is actually defined in the file: Good, it is defined. Let me run the development server to see if there are any runtime errors: Let me check the terminal output after a moment: Let me wait a bit more for the build to complete: The build is progressing. Let me wait a bit more for it to complete: Excellent! The build completed successfully! I can see that Nuxt has compiled successfully and the application is now running on `http://localhost:58928/`. Let me open the browser to verify that the canvas transforms refactor is working properly:

_**User**_

It's working! Now, how about some tests?

---

_**Assistant**_

Excellent! I'm glad the canvas transforms refactor is working properly. Now let's add some tests for the new canvas transforms module. Since we structured it with pure functions and dependency injection, it should be very testable.

Let me first check what testing setup we have and then create comprehensive tests: Great! We have Vitest set up with proper p5.js mocking. Let me check the existing test to see the pattern: Perfect! Now let me create comprehensive tests for the canvas transforms module. I'll create tests that focus on the pure functions first, then test the factory function with mocked dependencies: Now let me enhance the test setup to better support p5.js graphics mocking. I need to add some additional mocks to the setup file: 
```

```
Now let's run the tests to see how our canvas transforms module performs: There's a dependency issue with rollup. Let me try to fix this by clearing the dependencies and reinstalling:

_**User**_

Please create an overview document for canvas-transforms similar to sketch.md and color-system.md. One file, canvas-transforms.md should be enough.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a comprehensive overview document for the canvas-transforms module. Let me first check the existing documentation files to understand the format and style, then create a similar document. Let me check the `color-system.md` and `sketch.md` files to understand the documentation format: Now let me check the structure of the canvas-transforms module to understand what to document: Let me also check the core-transforms file to understand the pure functions: Now I'll create a comprehensive documentation file for the canvas-transforms module: Perfect! I've created a comprehensive documentation file for the canvas-transforms module at `canvas-transforms.md`. 

The documentation covers:

## Key Sections:

1. **Overview & Architecture** - Explains the modular design and factory pattern
2. **Public API** - Detailed documentation of all transform functions
3. **Pure Functions** - Documentation of the core testable functions
4. **Integration** - How it works with recording, layers, and app state
5. **Usage Examples** - Practical code examples for implementation and testing
6. **Performance Considerations** - Memory management and optimization notes
7. **Limitations** - Known issues like undo system integration gaps
8. **Future Enhancements** - Potential improvements and testing expansion
9. **Migration Notes** - Context about the refactor from `sketch.js`

## Documentation Features:

- **Consistent with existing docs** - Follows the same style as `color-system.md` and `sketch.md`
- **Comprehensive API coverage** - Documents all functions, parameters, and return values
- **Code examples** - Shows both usage in the application and testing scenarios
- **Architecture explanation** - Details the dependency injection and factory patterns
- **Migration context** - Explains how this fits into the broader codebase refactoring effort

The documentation should help both current development and future maintenance of the canvas transforms module, making it easy to understand the API, test the functions, and extend the functionality.

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a commit message following the Conventional Commits specification for the canvas transforms refactor and documentation work we've completed. Now I'll create a comprehensive commit message following the Conventional Commits specification: The commit failed because JavaScript Standard Style doesn't recognize the Vitest globals (`describe`, ``, `expect`, etc.). I need to fix the linting configuration first. Let me add the Vitest environment to the Standard Style configuration: Let me check if there's a Standard configuration section and add Vitest globals: I need to add Vitest globals to the Standard configuration. Let me update the package.json: 
```

```
Now let's try to commit again: It looks like the commit went through but was cut off in the display. Let me check the git log to confirm the commit was successful:
