In debug, how do I configure the debugger to skip certain files?

_**Assistant**_

You can configure the debugger to skip certain files using the **skipFiles** setting in your debug configuration (launch.json file).

1. Open your launch.json file by using the **Debug: Add Configuration...** command.



2. Add the **skipFiles** array to your debug configuration. Here are some common patterns:

   - Skip all node_modules: `"<node_internals>/**"`
   - Skip specific files: `"${workspaceFolder}/dist/**"`
   - Skip files by pattern: `"**/vendor/**"`

3. Example launch.json configuration:
   

You can also use the **Debug: Toggle Skipping this File** command to dynamically skip the currently open file during debugging.
