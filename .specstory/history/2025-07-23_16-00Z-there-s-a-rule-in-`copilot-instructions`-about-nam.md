# There's a rule in `copilot-instructions` about nam (2025-07-23 16:00Z)

_**User**_

There's a rule in `copilot-instructions` about naming plan files, but we created several plans before this naming convention was added. So there are several plans without a numeric prefix. Let's get those renamed with a prefix like "0A.". There are also plans with a number-prefix followed by a hypen - let's rename those to use a dot instead of a hyphen. When I said "rename" - we should probably use `git mv` instead of purely mv to retain history. I'm open to suggestions if there are better solutions.

The attempted renames failed because the destination filenames were the same as the source (the files were already named correctly or the script didn't match the intended files). 

Here's a better approach:
- Only rename files that lack a numeric prefix (e.g., `drawing-modes-refactor.md` → `0A.drawing-modes-refactor.md`)
- For files with a number and hyphen (e.g., `01-e2e-phase1-complete.md`), change the hyphen to a dot (→ `01.e2e-phase1-complete.md`).

Would you like to see a preview of the exact rename commands before running them, or should I proceed with the corrected renames?

As far as I'm concerned, it worked. Looks like the last rename command included not just nn- prefixes but also nn. prefixes - and obvs those did not need renaming. But all of the nn- and non-number prefixed plans have been updated.

I've added the files to stage, Let's make a small commit for this info. And a small changelog entry.

```

```
- All plan files in `` have been renamed to follow the numeric-dot prefix convention (e.g., `01-e2e-phase1-complete.md` → `01.e2e-phase1-complete.md`, `drawing-modes-refactor.md` → `0A.drawing-modes-refactor.md`).
- The changes have been committed with a clear message.
- A changelog entry has been added under "Changed" in the Unreleased section.

This completes the requested update.

What are your guidelines for adding to the CHANGELOG file? I am asking about both explicit instructions I have added, but also your general "best practices" that you implement.

---

_**Assistant**_

Here are my guidelines for adding to the `CHANGELOG.md` file, combining your explicit instructions and general best practices:

---

### **Explicit User Instructions**

- **Always ask before creating a changelog entry for any git commit.**
- For substantial non-commit changes, prompt the user about adding a changelog entry.
- **Include in changelog:**
  - API endpoint changes
  - Frontend features or UI changes
  - User-facing bug fixes
  - Documentation that affects end users
  - Breaking changes or security fixes
- **Exclude from changelog:**
  - Internal refactoring, tests, build changes
  - LLM instruction updates
  - Code comments or internal docs
- Use [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format:
  - Sections: `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Security`
  - Entries should be clear, user-focused, and specific.
- Default to PATCH version bump for changelog entries; ask user to confirm MINOR/MAJOR bumps.
- Avoid vague entries (e.g., "Updated some stuff").

---

### **General Best Practices**

- **Write for end users:** Focus on what changed from a user's perspective, not just technical details.
- **Be concise and specific:** Each entry should clearly describe the change and its impact.
- **Group related changes:** Use section headers to organize by type (`Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, etc.).
- **Chronological order:** List changes in the order they were made, most recent first.
- **Reference affected files or features:** When possible, mention the module, feature, or file.
- **Use consistent language and formatting:** Follow the established style for readability.
- **Document breaking changes clearly:** Highlight any changes that require user action or may affect compatibility.

---

**Summary:**  
I follow your explicit rules for when and what to include, use the Keep a Changelog format, and apply best practices for clarity, specificity, and user focus. I always confirm with you before adding or updating changelog entries.

---

_**User**_

There are no dates or version in the changelog - is this because we have not merged with main or published since we started the log?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, that's correct. The absence of dates and version numbers in your `CHANGELOG.md` is because all entries are currently under the `[Unreleased]` section. This means the changes have not yet been merged into `main` or published as a new release. 

When you publish or tag a new release, you should:
- Move the relevant entries from `[Unreleased]` to a new version section (e.g., `## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-23`)
- Add the release date next to the version.

Until then, all ongoing changes remain grouped under `[Unreleased]` as per Keep a Changelog best practices.

---

_**User**_

My goal with the most recent branch was to get e2e tests working. I currently have more than half passing, compared to just 2 passing when I started. I feel good about the progress and understand many of the reasons why remaining tests fail. Instead of finishing the tests, I would like to merge and publish - and then move on to some other tasks and plans, revisitng e2e tests periodically. Does this sound reasonable?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, that sounds reasonable. Merging and publishing after substantial progress on E2E test stability is a good practice, especially since you now have a much higher pass rate and understand the remaining issues. This allows you to capture and share improvements, then iterate on the tests in future cycles without blocking other work.

Before merging, consider:
- Documenting the current E2E test status in the changelog (already present).
- Optionally, add a note in the changelog or release notes about ongoing E2E test improvements and known limitations.

Would you like help preparing the release section in `CHANGELOG.md` (with version and date), or do you want to keep everything under `[Unreleased]` until after merge?

---

_**User**_

I can't remember how sequencing of all of this works - I want to bump the minor version of the app (in package.json) from 1.1.1 to 1.2.0 - there's isn't big user-facing changes, but the e2e tests and scss cleanup and worthy of a minor bump. We will need to commit changes, like changelog, as well.
