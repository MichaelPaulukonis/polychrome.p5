List all my github repositories.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you list all your GitHub repositories. Let me search for your repositories. You have 99 GitHub repositories! This shows the first 30 repositories returned from the search. Here's a summary of your top repositories by stars:

## Most Popular Repositories (by stars):
1. **malepropp** (19 ⭐) - Poorly Applied and Misunderstood Proppian Narratological Generator
2. **pmwiki-bootstrap-skin** (18 ⭐) - A Bootstrap skin for PmWiki  
3. **NaNoGenMo2014** (10 ⭐) - National Novel Generation Month 2014
4. **common-corpus** (8 ⭐) - Common texts for NLG/NLP projects
5. **NaNoGenMo2015** (7 ⭐) - National Novel Generation Month 2015

## Recent Activity:
- **polychrome.p5** - Last updated June 2025, actively maintained with 19 open issues
- **duo-chrome** - Your newest repo (Dec 2024), for overlaying monochrome images
- **canvas-sketches** - Creative coding with Matt DesLauriers tools (June 2024)
- **crude-collage-painter** - Collage creation tool (May 2024)

## Project Categories:
- **Creative/Generative**: Multiple NaNoGenMo projects, poetry generation, text processing
- **Web Development**: PmWiki skins, web text sketches
- **P5.js/Creative Coding**: Processing sketches, canvas projects
- **Tools/Libraries**: Text processing, image editing, corpus management

Would you like me to get more details about any specific repositories, or would you like to see the remaining repositories (since this shows 30 of your 99 total repositories)?

Do you have a limit of viewing the number of repos? Becuase GitHub itself shows me a higher number.

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! The GitHub API search has pagination limits. By default, it only returns 30 results per page, and I only showed you the first page. Let me get more of your repositories by fetching additional pages. Let me try a different approach to get all your repositories. The search might have limits, so let me also check what GitHub itself shows as your total repository count: Ah! You're absolutely correct. Your GitHub profile shows you have **240 public repositories**, not 99. The search API was showing incomplete results. Let me try fetching your repositories using a different method: Yes, I do have limitations when viewing repositories through the GitHub API. Let me explain what's happening and get you the accurate count.

The GitHub search API I used earlier has pagination limits - it typically returns only 30 results per page by default, and there's also a maximum of 1,000 results total that can be retrieved through search endpoints. However, there are other ways to get a more accurate count.

Let me try a different approach to get your complete repository count: Perfect! Now I have the accurate information. According to your GitHub user profile data from the API, you have **240 public repositories**.

The discrepancy you noticed earlier was indeed due to the limitations of the search endpoint I initially used:

1. **Search API limitations**: The repository search endpoint I used first only shows paginated results (typically 30 per page) and has a maximum limit of 1,000 total results that can be retrieved through search.

2. **Profile API accuracy**: The user profile endpoint (which I just used) gives the authoritative count directly from GitHub's database - showing your actual total of 240 public repositories.

So your GitHub profile page showing 240 repositories is correct, and that matches what the GitHub API reports in your user profile data. The initial search results only showed a subset of your repositories due to pagination and API limitations.

Your account statistics:
- **Public repositories**: 240
- **Public gists**: 63
- **Followers**: 54
- **Following**: 50
- **Account created**: October 20, 2012

How can I view the logs inside of the docker-container that is running this github-mcp-server? I can see it in "Docker Desktop"

---

_**Assistant**_

You can view the logs of your docker container running the github-mcp-server in several ways. Since you can already see it in Docker Desktop, here are the different methods:

## 1. Docker Desktop GUI (what you're already using)
- Click on the container name in Docker Desktop
- Go to the "Logs" tab to see real-time logs

## 2. Command Line Methods

First, let me help you find the container name/ID: Great! I can see your github-mcp-server container is running with the name `nervous_babbage`. Now here are the different ways to view its logs:

## Command Line Options:

**View current logs:** I can help you view the logs for your running github-mcp-server Docker container. Since you can already see it in Docker Desktop, here are several ways to access the logs:

## Method 1: Docker Desktop GUI (Easiest)
Since you can already see the container in Docker Desktop:
1. Click on your github-mcp-server container in the Docker Desktop interface
2. Click on the "Logs" tab to view real-time logs
3. You can also use the search functionality to filter specific log entries

## Method 2: Command Line
Let me first check what Docker containers are currently running to identify your github-mcp-server container: Let me try again to check the running containers: Perfect! I can see your github-mcp-server container is running with the name `nervous_babbage`. Here are the command line options for viewing logs:

## Command Line Log Options:

### View current logs: I can help you view the logs for your running github-mcp-server Docker container. Let me first check what containers are currently running and then show you how to access the logs.

Please list top-level folders you have access to.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll list the top-level directories I have access to using the filesystem tools. Based on the filesystem access, I can only access the `/app` directory. Let me check what's in there: It looks like I only have access to the `/app` directory, which contains a `server` file. This appears to be running inside a containerized environment.

However, for viewing Docker container logs, you have several options:

## Via Docker Desktop GUI:
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Go to the "Containers" tab
3. Find your github-mcp-server container
4. Click on the container name to open its details
5. Click on the "Logs" tab to view the container logs

## Via Command Line:
You can use these Docker commands from your host machine (not from within this container):

```bash
# List running containers to find the container name/ID
docker ps

# View logs for a specific container (replace with your container name/ID)
docker logs <container-name-or-id>

# View logs with timestamps
docker logs -t <container-name-or-id>

# Follow logs in real-time
docker logs -f <container-name-or-id>

# View last N lines of logs
docker logs --tail 50 <container-name-or-id>
```

Since you mentioned you can see the container in Docker Desktop, the GUI method would be the easiest way to view the logs.
