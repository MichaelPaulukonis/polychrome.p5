# Checking unmerged changes in Git branch deletion (2025-07-28 13:07Z)

_**User**_

I asked git to delete a branch ("drawing-mode-refactor"), and it errored "not fully merged". There has been a lot of development on the main branch since activity on the target branch, and I thought I had merged everything in. How can I check exactly what git think has not been merged? Doing a diff on the branch vs main would bring in a ton of documentation and other files that have nothing to do with the refactoring project.

```
 âœ— gbd drawing-mode-refactor 
error: The branch 'drawing-mode-refactor' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D drawing-mode-refactor'.
```

_**Assistant**_

To check what git thinks has not been merged from the `drawing-mode-refactor` branch into `main`, you can use the following git commands:

1. **Compare the branches** to see what commits are in `drawing-mode-refactor` but not in `main`:
   ```bash
   git log main..drawing-mode-refactor
   ```

2. **Check for unmerged files** specifically:
   ```bash
   git diff main...drawing-mode-refactor --name-only
   ```

3. **See a summary of changes** that would be merged:
   ```bash
   git diff --stat main...drawing-mode-refactor
   ```

These commands will show you exactly what git considers to be unmerged content. The `main..drawing-mode-refactor` syntax shows commits that are in `drawing-mode-refactor` but not in `main`, which is what git uses to determine if a branch is "fully merged".

If you want to be extra cautious, you can also create a temporary branch from main and attempt a merge to see what would happen:
```bash
git checkout -b temp-merge-check main
git merge drawing-mode-refactor
git checkout main
git branch -d temp-merge-check
```

This approach lets you verify the merge without affecting your actual branches. If the comparison commands show no relevant changes (only documentation and unrelated files), then you can safely use `git branch -D drawing-mode-refactor` to force delete the branch.

In git, what is the function of the branch-dot-dot-branch parameter?

---

_**Assistant**_

In git, the `branch1..branch2` parameter (double dot notation) is used to show commits that are in `branch2` but not in `branch1`. 

Specifically:
- `main..drawing-mode-refactor` shows commits that exist in `drawing-mode-refactor` but are NOT in `main`
- This is exactly what git uses to determine if a branch is "fully merged" - if there are any commits shown by this comparison, git considers the branch not fully merged

The syntax works as:
```
git log main..drawing-mode-refactor
```

This will display all commits that would be lost if you deleted `drawing-mode-refactor` without merging them into `main`.

Conversely:
- `drawing-mode-refactor..main` would show commits in `main` but not in `drawing-mode-refactor`

There's also a triple dot variant (`...`) which shows commits that are in either branch but not in both (symmetric difference).

How do I delete a remote branch? A branch on origin.

---

_**Assistant**_

To delete a remote branch on `origin`, use:

```bash
git push origin --delete drawing-mode-refactor
```

or the older syntax:

```bash
git push origin :drawing-mode-refactor
```

Both commands will remove the branch from the remote repository.
