# Text rendering alternatives for existing content (2025-06-17 23:15Z)

_**User**_

I'm looking for a word/phrase that is similar to "text generation", but refers to using existing not, not creating new texts. In this context, the user paints with text that has been pre-selected, and the text appears by Sequential letter, random letter, or word-based.

_**Assistant**_

Based on your description, here are some terms that might fit better than "text generation":

**"Text rendering"** - This emphasizes the visual display/painting aspect while avoiding the "creation" implication of "generation"

**"Text inscription"** - Suggests writing/painting with existing text content

**"Text manifestation"** - Implies bringing pre-existing text into visible form

**"Text revelation"** - Emphasizes the gradual appearance (sequential/random letters)

**"Text materialization"** - Focuses on making existing text appear/become visible

**"Text painting"** - Direct reference to your painting metaphor

**"Text inscription modes"** or **"Text rendering modes"** - If you want to be more technical and reference the different display methods (sequential, random, word-based)

Given the painting context and the gradual appearance mechanisms you described, I'd lean toward **"text rendering"** or **"text inscription"** as they best capture the act of visually displaying pre-existing content without implying creation of new text.

What do we call browser-based local storage (not file-based)?

---

_**Assistant**_

Browser-based local storage that's not file-based is commonly referred to as:

**"Web Storage"** - The umbrella term for browser storage APIs

**"Browser Storage"** - General term for client-side storage in browsers

**"Local Storage"** - Specifically refers to the `localStorage` API (persistent across sessions)

**"Session Storage"** - Refers to the `sessionStorage` API (cleared when tab closes)

**"Client-side Storage"** - Broader term encompassing all browser storage mechanisms

**"In-memory Storage"** - Sometimes used, though technically localStorage persists to disk

Other specific types include:
- **IndexedDB** - For larger, structured data
- **WebSQL** - Deprecated SQL-based storage
- **Cookies** - Small key-value storage sent with requests

The most common and accurate terms are **"localStorage"** (for the specific API) or **"Web Storage"** (for the general concept).
