# This method makes a deep copy of a object (props)  (2025-06-21 09:57:53)

_**User**_

This method makes a deep copy of a object (props) and stores it with other values in an array. The initial deep-copy attempt is done through JSON.parse(JSON.stringify()) which is maybe not the best way to do it?

What are some alternative approaches, and the pros and cons of each?

I am also happy with leaving things as they are.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at your `store` function, you're right that `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` has limitations. Here are the main alternatives and their trade-offs:

## Current Approach: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())
**Pros:**
- Built-in, no dependencies
- Fast for simple objects
- Works well for serializable data

**Cons:**
- Loses functions, undefined, symbols
- Converts dates to strings
- Loses prototype chain
- Can't handle circular references
- No support for Map, Set, etc.

## Alternative Approaches:

### 1. Structured Clone (Modern browsers)
```javascript
params = structuredClone(props)
```
**Pros:** Handles more types (Date, RegExp, Map, Set), built-in
**Cons:** Newer API, still can't clone functions

### 2. Lodash cloneDeep
```javascript
import { cloneDeep } from 'lodash'
params = cloneDeep(props)
```
**Pros:** Handles most cases well, battle-tested
**Cons:** Adds dependency, larger bundle

### 3. Custom recursive clone
```javascript
const deepClone = (obj) => {
  if (obj === null || typeof obj !== 'object') return obj
  if (obj instanceof Date) return new Date(obj)
  if (Array.isArray(obj)) return obj.map(deepClone)
  return Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(obj).map(([k, v]) => [k, deepClone(v)]))
}
```
**Pros:** Lightweight, customizable
**Cons:** Need to handle edge cases yourself

### 4. Ramda clone (since you're already using Ramda)
```javascript
import { clone } from 'ramda'
params = clone(props)  // shallow
// or use a custom deep clone with Ramda utilities
```

## Recommendation:

Given your current fallback strategy with the `dry` function, your approach is actually quite pragmatic. The JSON method works for most canvas/drawing parameters (numbers, strings, booleans, simple objects), and your fallback handles the edge cases gracefully.

**If you want to improve it**, I'd suggest `structuredClone` as a drop-in replacement if you're targeting modern browsers:

### [record.js](file:///Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/polychrome.p5/src/record.js)

Replace JSON cloning with structuredClone for better type support, keeping the existing fallback.

```javascript
// ...existing code...

const store = ({ action, config, params: props }) => {
  let params
  if (props) {
    try {
      // Use structuredClone for better type support (modern browsers)
      params = typeof structuredClone !== 'undefined' 
        ? structuredClone(props)
        : JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(props))
    } catch (_) {
      params = mergeAll(Object.keys(props).map(key => ({ [key]: dry(props[key]) })))
    }
  }
  recs.push({ action, config, params })
}

// ...existing code...
```

This gives you better cloning when available while maintaining compatibility. Your current approach is solid for a canvas app where most parameters are primitives or simple objects.

TBH, I'd lean more towards a ramda because I'd like to use it more. Which is weak motivation. Tell me more about "structuredClone" - I'm not familiar with this method.

## About `structuredClone`

`structuredClone` is a relatively new browser API (added in 2022) that provides deep cloning using the same algorithm browsers use internally for postMessage and IndexedDB operations.

**Browser support:**
- Chrome 98+, Firefox 94+, Safari 15.4+
- Node.js 17+ (with `--experimental-global-webcrypto` flag), Node.js 18+ (stable)

**What it handles better than JSON:**
- `Date` objects (preserved as Date, not converted to string)
- `RegExp` objects
- `Map` and `Set` collections
- `ArrayBuffer` and typed arrays
- `Blob` and `File` objects
- Circular references (throws error instead of hanging)

**What it still can't clone:**
- Functions
- DOM elements
- Symbols (unless they're well-known symbols)
- Prototype chains

## Ramda Approach

Since you want to use more Ramda, here's a clean approach using Ramda's utilities:

### [record.js](file:///Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/polychrome.p5/src/record.js)

Use Ramda's functional approach for deep cloning with better composability.

```javascript
import diff from './diff'
import { mergeAll, clone, is, map, when, pipe } from 'ramda'

// ...existing code...

// Ramda-based deep clone
const deepClone = pipe(
  when(is(Array), map(deepClone)),
  when(is(Object), pipe(
    Object.entries,
    map(([k, v]) => [k, deepClone(v)]),
    Object.fromEntries
  )),
  clone // Ramda's shallow clone for primitives/dates
)

const store = ({ action, config, params: props }) => {
  let params
  if (props) {
    try {
      params = deepClone(props)
    } catch (_) {
      params = mergeAll(Object.keys(props).map(key => ({ [key]: dry(props[key]) })))
    }
  }
  recs.push({ action, config, params })
}

// ...existing code...
```

**Pros of Ramda approach:**
- Functional composition style
- Leverages Ramda utilities you're already using
- More predictable behavior
- Easy to customize for specific needs

**Cons:**
- Slightly more verbose
- Still won't handle all edge cases (functions, symbols)
- Performance might be slightly slower than native methods

Given your preference for Ramda and the fact that you're likely dealing with simple canvas parameters (numbers, strings, arrays), the Ramda approach would be both idiomatic and sufficient for your use case.

Thanks! The new `deepClone` method is in a try..catch with ramda's mergeAll as the fallback. Is this necessary with the new version of deepClone?

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right to question this! The Ramda-based `deepClone` is much more predictable than the JSON approach, but there are still a few edge cases where it could fail:

1. **Circular references** - The recursive nature could cause stack overflow
2. **Very deeply nested objects** - Could hit recursion limits
3. **Exotic objects** - Functions, symbols, or other non-standard objects could cause issues

However, for a canvas app dealing with configuration parameters (numbers, strings, arrays, simple objects), these edge cases are extremely unlikely.

**My recommendation:** Keep the try/catch for robustness, but you could simplify it since the Ramda version is much more reliable:

### [record.js](file:///Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/polychrome.p5/src/record.js)

Simplify the fallback since Ramda deepClone is more reliable than JSON approach.

````javascript
// ...existing code...

const store = ({ action, config, params: props }) => {
  let params
  if (props) {
    try {
      params = deepClone(props)
    } catch (_) {
      // Fallback for edge cases (circular refs, exotic objects)
      params = mergeAll(Object.keys(props).map(key => ({ [key]: dry(props[key]) })))
    }
  }
  recs.push({ action, config, params })
}

// ...existing code...
````

The try/catch is still worth keeping as a safety net, but with the Ramda approach, you're much less likely to hit the fallback. Given that this is for recording canvas parameters, the extra safety is minimal overhead for good defensive programming.

If you're confident about your data types and want to remove it entirely, that would also be reasonable for this use case.

I no longer recall why the function `dry` is called `dry`. I don't think it's "don't repeat yourself" - I think it is more like the opposite of hydration, since we are "drying out" an object to store it. Does this make sense based on the code? Can you suggest a better name?

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the `dry` function, you're absolutely right about it being the opposite of hydration! It's "drying out" complex objects by reducing them to just their constructor name (like `"Date"`, `"RegExp"`, etc.) when they can't be properly cloned.

The function takes objects that are too complex to serialize and reduces them to a simple string representation - essentially removing all the "moisture" (data/methods) and leaving just the basic type information.

Here are some better name suggestions:

- `dehydrate` - Most directly opposite of hydrate
- `simplify` - Reduces complex objects to simple representations  
- `stringify` - Converts objects to string representations
- `typeOnly` - Extracts just the type information
- `flatten` - Reduces complex structure to simple value
- `reduce` - Reduces object to minimal representation

### [record.js](file:///Users/michaelpaulukonis/projects/polychrome.p5/src/record.js)

Rename `dry` to `dehydrate` for clearer intent - converting complex objects to simple string representations.

```javascript
// ...existing code...

const dehydrate = val => typeof (val) === 'object' ? val.constructor.name : val

// ...existing code...

const store = ({ action, config, params: props }) => {
  let params
  if (props) {
    try {
      params = deepClone(props)
    } catch (_) {
      // Fallback for edge cases (circular refs, exotic objects)
      params = mergeAll(Object.keys(props).map(key => ({ [key]: dehydrate(props[key]) })))
    }
  }
  recs.push({ action, config, params })
}

// ...existing code...
```

I'd recommend `dehydrate` as it best captures the hydration/dehydration metaphor you identified - it's removing the complex internal structure and leaving just the essential type information for storage.
